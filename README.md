# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on an Airbnb dataset to understand the distribution, pricing, reviews, and availability of listings. Interactive **Plotly visualizations** are used to explore trends and patterns in the data.

The goal is to uncover insights such as:
- Price distribution across neighborhoods and room types  
- Popular neighborhoods and room types  
- Review activity and availability patterns  
- Geographic distribution of listings
